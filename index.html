            <p>I studied at Kutztown University and was awarded a B.S Psychology because I had always thought my career would be centered around humanistic values and needs. While attending school I was working my way up the corporate ladder to a small but
                growing high-end restaurant group in the Lehigh Valley. I was offered a coveted executive- mananagement position for 10 years at Lehigh Valley's ultra-sleek Paxos Restaurants group, earning 3 differnet general manager positions and finally
                assistant director. Groomed by a genious director of operations I was being prepared to run multiple locations some with staff sizes in excess of 100 employees. Naturually gravitating to all matters front of house and paradoxically those
                related to back-house technology, I began considering my natural tendancy to lean towards technology as a possible career-direction. It wasn't until my return home from a volunteer mission in Quito, Ecuador that I firmly made a commitment
                to break into the industry by any means availble. </p>
            <p>Entreprenuerial tendencies tethered to passion and ...to measure and study human behavior integreated with technology and just plain luck have afforded me the opportunity to begin studying Web Development technology at Triology's bootcamp
                program held at Univesity of Pennsylvania, graduation expected in May 2020. </p>
